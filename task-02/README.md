# Terminal Hunt

This was really a fun task to do, it just shows you how powerful and useful git is. So i have included the detailed terminal commands, screenshot of the PDF and the git commands that i've used to get the secret password is all documented in the [SOLUTION.md](https://github.com/ArunKrishnan0x168/amfoss-tasks/blob/main/task-02/SOLUTION.md) in this folder. Once i thank the team for developing such an amazing task.
