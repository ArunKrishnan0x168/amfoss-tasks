# Find The Bug

This was really an interesting experience as i never had any experience with C# or the .Net framework. At first  this task was a bit initmidating but with a few google searches i got to know about all the properties used and learned some C# along the process.While Debugging i used the errors shown in the terminal to my advantage and fixed errors one by one,the task was tiring but fun.

I've added the Debugged(Working) client-server application to this task-05 repo, You guys can inspect the code also where ever i made changes i've added a  ``` Debugging-Done ``` command to point out the changes that i've made so hopefully that helps whil inspecting the code

I've also added the video(mp4) of the debugged version running on my laptop

Thanks again for this interesting task, Hopefully i'll be able make one like this in the future for my juniors as a part of amFOSS
