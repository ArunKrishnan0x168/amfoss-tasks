This task was easy for me as i have some experience in web development but it brought back so many memories like when i created my first web app, in this folder i'm posting index.html,index.js,style.css and sounds which was used to create the drum kit website.

I've linked the css and js,added even listeners for sounds, added different background colors for each button,body and the google font that i'm using is called "sofia" and is linked in the header of the html file.

I've also added keypress events so that when you press the respective keys the sounds will be played.

Here is a screenshot of my drumkit website :
