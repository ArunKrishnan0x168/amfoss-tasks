# CineBot

Wow what an experience, i learned so much while making this bot(arun_movie_bot), the code is included in this folder [arun_movie_bot.py](https://github.com/ArunKrishnan0x168/amfoss-tasks/blob/main/task-04/arun_movie_bot.py) and is well documented , i've pointed out each TO_DO tasks, also i've added a gif  of my bot working and i've also added this code to [replit](https://replit.com/@ArunKrishnan6/arunmoviebot#main.py).Thank you.
