# CineBot

Wow what an experience, i learned so much while making this bot(arun_movie_bot),As i had no previous experience in making telegram bots it was hard to tackle but my experience in building discord bots came into play and by reading the API documentation and with the help of some yt videos i was able to create this bot.

The code is included in this folder [arun_movie_bot.py](https://github.com/ArunKrishnan0x168/amfoss-tasks/blob/main/task-04/arun_movie_bot.py) and is well documented , i've pointed out each TO_DO tasks, also i've added a gif  of my bot working and i've also added this code to [replit](https://replit.com/@ArunKrishnan6/arunmoviebot#main.py).Thank you.
