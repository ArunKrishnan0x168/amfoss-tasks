# Flame game

As i've never used flutter or flame before i had to learn it from scratch atleast what was required for task-06,Well it was an interesting experience to do this task as always got to learn a lot from this task as well.The way how flutter handles a project without creating much bloat is amazing also it's cross platform which makes it even better and flame is just an amazing game library.

The problems that i faced while doing this task was that i was unable to load some sprites due to some mistakes that i made but was able to rectify it later also had some trouble with the camera animations but again was able to rectify it.

I did a lot of google searches, watched a lot of videos after which i was able to understand what was going on and what i needed to do,it was a hard task for me,but i had fun doing it, All the code which you guys can inspect is inside [lib](https://github.com/ArunKrishnan0x168/amfoss-tasks/tree/main/task-06/lib) directory in this task-06 folder.

I'm also attaching a video(gif) of my app working on my laptop(i'm not using an android emulator for flutter, i'm using chrome to render)
