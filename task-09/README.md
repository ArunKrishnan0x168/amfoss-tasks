# Krypto Scrapper

This was an interesting task i've actually made a webscraper in the past using javascript and xhr but it was not this detailed or anything, i had some problems as i'm kind of new to the rust programming language i see that it has a more difficult learning curve but it was fun to us.

I'm using css selectors for scraping the issue with this is it might get changed when the website gets updated,i'll update my code also once that happens.

The source code is present in [src_code](https://github.com/ArunKrishnan0x168/amfoss-tasks/tree/main/task-09/src) and i've also added all the required files for the rust ecosystem along with the csv file produced when the script is ran.

Thank you for this amazing opportunity which helped me in getting to more about webscraping and rust.
