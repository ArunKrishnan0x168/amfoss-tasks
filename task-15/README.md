# Project Euler

A set of very interesting questions which were quite fun to do,Through this task i've learned how time constraints affect you in a real world contest as some of submissions failed due to taking a lot of time to solve the problem, also taught me about how important  optimization of an algorithm really is.

I've included all the solution files in this task-15 folder.

Thank you.
