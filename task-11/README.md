# Figma Ninja

This task was different from other tasks and was very interesting, a  breath of fresh air to say the least, by doing this task now i'm able to better prototype my ideas through figma and that helps a lot.

I'm including the [figma_file](https://github.com/ArunKrishnan0x168/amfoss-tasks/blob/main/task-11/amFOSS%20app.fig) which can be loaded into figma to view. Also the exported PDF version of the design[pdf_version](https://github.com/ArunKrishnan0x168/amfoss-tasks/blob/main/task-11/amFOSS%20app.pdf).

Here is the design for the Login screen
