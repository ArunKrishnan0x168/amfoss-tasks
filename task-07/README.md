# Go WASM

Wow i mean by far this was one of the hardest task other than task-3, The idea of Wasm always fascinated me but i never tried it, I thank you guys for this task, I had to learn everything from scratch like i never used 'go',so i had to learn some 'go',I made a lot of google searches which really helped me in understanding go and wasm also this video really helped a lot [reference_video](https://youtu.be/10Mz3z-W1BE),So yeah Once again Thank you guys :).

I've included the completed main.go file in the task-07 folder along with wasm_exec.js and also the wasm version of main.go ie, main.wasm,i've also added a  video(gif) of the program in action.
