## My views on the tasks

The tasks were crafted just amazingly it was a great learning experience.
These tasks introduced me to many new technologies like flutter,wasm etc, it was fun researching and studying about them.I'd say these tasks are designed in such a way that even if the person doesn't know how to solve the task initially but through continous effort could solve the problem,Many of these tasks i was unable to do at first but i kept on trying on and on until i finished it, that's what in my point of view makes these tasks great. Thank you guys for making such an amazing task list.


## My Introduction

Hi Seniors ðŸ‘‹. I am Arun Krishnan from Alappuzha,Kerala.I've not learned
programming in my school as i was a biology student but when covid came i learned a lot about programming and computer science in general during lockdown which really helped me in doing these tasks.I came to know about amFOSS through the internet, eversince i wanted to be a part of this club.I feel like the club would provide an environment in which i could develop my skills on both technical and communication domains with the help of mentors at amFOSS.I'd like to contribute more to the OpenSource community and to team amFOSS as well,would love to be a part of this amazing club.


**Thank you**
