## My views on the tasks

The tasks were crafted just amazingly it was a great learning experience.
These tasks introduced me to many new technologies like flutter,wasm etc, it was fun researching and studying about them.I'd say these tasks are designed in such a way that even if the person doesn't know how to solve the task initially but through continous effort could solve the problem,Many of these tasks i was unable to do at first but i kept on trying on and on until i finish it, that's what in my point of view makes these tasks great. Thank you guys for making such an amazing task list.
