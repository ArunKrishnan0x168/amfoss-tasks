# INTROSPECTION

### Why must we choose you?

Hi guysðŸ‘‹, So i took biology in my 11'th and 12'th standard so you'd expect that i have no prior experience in programming or other tech related stuff but that's not true because during the past 2 years while we were working/studying from home i've actually used this time
for learning programming languages like python,c,c++,rust,javascript etc and have worked on many personal projects(some are there under [old_repos](https://github.com/ArunKrishnan0x168/old_repos) on this account), i also am familiar with many linux distros including arch,void,gentoo etc and i would really like to contribute more to the Open Source community as well.So yeah i really like doing these technological projects, it's like my one and only passion and i've always wanted to be a part of a group of similar minded people like you guys at amFOSS, If given a chance i'll give my 100% that's for sure.
